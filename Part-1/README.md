## 🦾 PART 1 — FULL INTERVIEW QUESTION BANK (Quick Revision)

**Conceptual:**

1. Difference between Linux kernel and a distro?
2. Explain kernel space vs user space.
3. What is the FHS, and name 5 key directories.
4. Explain the permission triad (owner/group/others) with an example.
5. Difference between su and sudo.
6. What is systemd, and what is PID 1?
7. Difference between SIGTERM and SIGKILL.
8. Explain how SSH key-based authentication works.
9. Difference between df and du.
10. Difference between apt update and apt upgrade.

**Command-Based (Practical):**

11. Write a command to recursively change ownership of /var/www/html to www-data.
12. Write a cron expression to run a script every day at 2:30 AM.
13. Write a command to find all files larger than 100MB modified in the last 7 days.
14. Write a sed command to replace "8080" with "9090" in a config file, saving changes.
15. Write a bash script that checks if Nginx is running and restarts it if not.
16. How do you add a user to the docker group?
17. How do you check which process is using a specific port?
18. Write an awk command to find the top memory-consuming process.
19. How do you safely edit /etc/sudoers?
20. How do you install Docker's official repository on Ubuntu?

**Scenario-Based (Most Common in Real Interviews):**

21. Production server disk is full — walk through your exact troubleshooting steps.
22. A deployed service doesn't survive a reboot — what did you likely forget, and how do you fix it?
23. You get "Permission denied (publickey)" connecting via SSH — list every possible cause and fix.
24. You need to deploy code to 5 servers efficiently — what approach and tools would you use?
25. A website returns 403 Forbidden after deployment — diagnose step by step.



## 🙌 PART 1 — FINAL SUMMARY

You've now covered the complete foundation every DevOps and Cloud engineer needs before touching AWS: how Linux is architected, how the file system is organized, how permissions and users protect the system, how to manage processes and services with systemctl/journalctl/cron, how to connect securely with SSH and move files with scp/rsync, how to archive and search through data with tar/grep/awk/sed/find, how to monitor system health, how to fetch data over the web with curl/wget, how to edit files with vim/nano, how to automate with bash scripting, and how to manage software with apt/dnf/snap.

Every single AWS EC2 instance, Docker container, and Jenkins server you build in the rest of this book will depend on the skills in this Part. Before moving to Part 2 — AWS Cloud Fundamentals, make sure you can comfortably: SSH into a server, navigate the file system, check and fix permissions, manage a systemd service, write a basic bash deployment script, and install software with the correct package manager — all without looking anything up.

Next up: [Part 2]()— AWS Cloud Fundamentals (EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, Security Groups, and the AWS CLI).
