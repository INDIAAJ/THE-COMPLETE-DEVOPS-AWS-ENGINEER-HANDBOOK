CHAPTER 10: SYSTEM MONITORING — top, htop, free, df, du, netstat, ss

10.1 Theory

System monitoring commands let you observe CPU, memory, disk, and network usage in real time — essential for diagnosing performance issues, capacity planning, and confirming whether a server is healthy.

10.2 top — Real-Time Process Monitor

bashtop

Sample Output:

top - 14:32:10 up 5 days,  2:15,  1 user,  load average: 0.15, 0.22, 0.18
Tasks: 110 total,   1 running, 109 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  3.2 us,  1.1 sy,  0.0 ni, 95.4 id,  0.2 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.1 si
MiB Mem :   1987.4 total,    412.1 free,    892.3 used,    683.0 buff/cache
MiB Swap:      0.0 total,      0.0 free,      0.0 used.    892.1 avail Mem

  PID USER   PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM   TIME+ COMMAND
  892 www-data 20  0  55000   8900   3200 S   0.3   0.4   0:12.4 nginx
 1044 mysql    20  0 890000 210000  15000 S   0.7   9.8   4:22.1 mysqld

Key things to check: load average (should generally stay below your number of CPU cores), %CPU/%MEM usage per process (top offenders sort to top by default), and overall free memory.

Inside top (interactive keys):


P — sort by CPU usage
M — sort by memory usage
k — kill a process (enter PID)
q — quit


10.3 htop — A Friendlier, Colorized top

bashsudo apt install htop -y     # Install (Ubuntu)
sudo dnf install htop -y      # Install (RHEL/Amazon Linux)
htop

htop shows the same information as top but with color-coded bars for CPU/memory per core, mouse support, easier process searching (F3), and easier killing (F9). Most engineers prefer htop when available, but top is always pre-installed everywhere, so know both.

10.4 free — Memory Usage

bashfree -h        # Human-readable (MB/GB instead of raw bytes)
free -m         # Show in megabytes specifically

Sample Output:

$ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           1.9Gi       892Mi       412Mi        45Mi       683Mi        1.0Gi
Swap:            0B          0B          0B

Important concept: "used" memory looks high, but Linux aggressively uses free RAM for disk caching (buff/cache) to speed things up — this cache is instantly reclaimed if an application needs it. The number that actually matters is the "available" column, not "used" or "free".

10.5 df — Disk Space (Filesystem Level)

bashdf -h              # Human-readable disk space, all mounted filesystems
df -h /             # Check space on a specific mount point only
df -i                # Show inode usage (can run out of inodes even with free disk space!)

Sample Output:

$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda1       20G   12G  7.2G  63% /
tmpfs           989M     0  989M   0% /dev/shm

10.6 du — Disk Usage (Directory/File Level)

bashdu -sh /var/log              # Total size of a specific directory (summary, human-readable)
du -sh /var/log/*              # Size of each item inside /var/log individually
du -sh /var/log/* | sort -rh     # Sort by size, largest first — great for finding what's eating disk space
du -h --max-depth=1 /var          # Show sizes one level deep only

df vs du — Critical Distinction:

dfduMeasuresFree/used space on the FILESYSTEM/partitionSpace used by specific FILES/directoriesUse case"Is my disk full?""WHAT is filling my disk?"Typical workflowRun df -h first to spot the problem, THEN du -sh to find the cause

10.7 netstat — Network Statistics (Legacy but Still Common)

bashnetstat -tulnp        # Show all listening TCP/UDP ports with process names
# -t = TCP, -u = UDP, -l = listening only, -n = numeric (don't resolve hostnames), -p = show process/PID

Sample Output:

Proto Local Address     Foreign Address   State    PID/Program name
tcp   0.0.0.0:22         0.0.0.0:*         LISTEN   612/sshd
tcp   0.0.0.0:80         0.0.0.0:*         LISTEN   892/nginx
tcp   127.0.0.1:3306      0.0.0.0:*         LISTEN   1044/mysqld

This tells you: SSH (22) and Nginx (80) are listening on all interfaces, but MySQL (3306) is only listening on localhost (127.0.0.1) — meaning it's NOT accessible from outside the server, which is a good security practice.

10.8 ss — Modern Replacement for netstat

ss is faster than netstat and is the recommended modern tool (netstat is deprecated on many distros).

bashss -tulnp             # Same flags, same output style as netstat
ss -t state established   # Show only established TCP connections
ss -s                       # Summary statistics

10.9 Real-World Example — Full Health Check Workflow

bashuptime                          # Quick load average + how long server's been up
free -h                          # Memory check
df -h                             # Disk check
top -bn1 | head -15                # One-time snapshot of top processes (good for scripts)
ss -tulnp                            # What ports/services are exposed

10.11 Best Practices


Always check the "available" column in free -h, not "free" — "free" is misleadingly low due to healthy disk caching.
Run df -h BEFORE du -sh when disk is full — df tells you WHERE the problem is, du tells you WHAT is causing it.
Set up automated alerting (CloudWatch in AWS, covered in Part 2) rather than manually checking top — manual checks don't scale.
Check inode usage (df -i) if you get "No space left on device" even when df -h shows free space — you can run out of inodes with millions of tiny files.


10.12 Common Mistakes


Panicking over high "used" memory in free -h without checking "available" first.
Using netstat on newer minimal distros where it's not installed by default — reach for ss instead.
Forgetting -h and staring at disk sizes in raw bytes, unable to quickly interpret them.
Not knowing that du and df can report DIFFERENT numbers when a process is still holding a deleted file open (the disk space isn't freed until the process restarts/closes the file handle).


10.13 Interview Questions


What's the difference between df and du?
Why might free -h show high "used" memory even on a healthy server?
How would you find the top 5 largest subdirectories inside /var/log?
What's the difference between netstat and ss, and why is ss generally preferred now?
How would you check which process is listening on port 8080?
What does "load average" in top/uptime actually represent?


10.14 Scenario-Based Question

Scenario: df -h shows / is 98% full, but running du -sh /* and adding up the numbers only accounts for 60% of the disk. Where is the missing space, and how do you find it?

(Approach: This is the classic "deleted-but-open-file-handle" problem — a process (often a log file) was deleted while still open by a running process, so the space isn't released. Find it with lsof +L1 or lsof | grep deleted, identify the PID, and restart that service to release the space.)

10.15 Troubleshooting


Issue: Server unresponsive/slow, unclear why.
Fix: Run uptime (load average), free -h (memory), df -h (disk), top (CPU hogs) — in that order, takes under a minute and covers 90% of causes.
Issue: Port appears closed even though the service is "running."
Fix: ss -tulnp | grep <port> to confirm what's actually listening and on which interface (0.0.0.0 vs 127.0.0.1 matters!).

10.17 Summary

top/htop, free, df/du, and netstat/ss together form your complete "server health dashboard" from the command line. In any performance-related interview question or real incident, your answer should follow the same pattern: check load → check memory → check disk → check network — this chapter gives you every command for each step.
